I have been working on sequential learning problems arising in stochastic optimization, distributed learning, bandits, bayesian optimization, and active online learning. My research focuses on establishing fundamental limits on feasible performance and developing machine learning algorithms that achieve or approach the performance limits under practical constraints like computation complexity and communication costs. You can find my detailed Research Statement [here](https://sudeepsalgia.github.io/assets/Research_Statement.pdf).
