I am Sudeep Salgia, a fifth year PhD candidate in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece). I am being advised by [Prof. Qing Zhao](https://zhao.ece.cornell.edu/). I have been working on sequential learning problems arising in stochastic optimization, distributed learning, and active learning. My research focuses on establishing fundamental limits on feasible performance and developing machine learning algorithms that achieve or approach the performance limits under practical constraints in terms of computation complexity and communication costs. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/).
