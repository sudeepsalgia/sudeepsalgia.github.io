I am Sudeep Salgia, a second year PhD student in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece). I am advised by [Prof. Qing Zhao](https://zhao.ece.cornell.edu/). I am interested in theoretical aspects of machine learning, broadly around the fields of statistical learning, optimization and active learning in online setups. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/).
