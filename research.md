I am passionate about math intensive problems relating to theoretical aspects of signal processing and their corresponding real world setups. I like working on image/signal estimation and recovery models, sparse signal processing, compressive sensing and medical image analysis and reconstruction. Besides these, I am highly motivated to work on cross discipline applications and to extend the application of knowledge from one domain to different domains to gain interesting insights.
