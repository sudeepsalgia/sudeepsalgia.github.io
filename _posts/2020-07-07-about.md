I am Sudeep Salgia, a fourth year PhD candidate in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece). I am being advised by [Prof. Qing Zhao](https://zhao.ece.cornell.edu/). I like to work on theoretical aspects of Machine Learning, broadly around the fields of Statistical Learning, Stochastic Optimization, non-parametric Bayesian Optimization, Hypothesis Testing, and Active Learning in online setups. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/).
