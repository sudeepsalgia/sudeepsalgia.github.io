I am Sudeep Salgia, a Postdoctoral Research Associate with [Prof. Yuejie Chi](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yuejiec/index.html) in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I obtained my Ph.D. from Cornell University in 2023 where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qing Zhao](https://zhao.ece.cornell.edu/). I have been working on sequential learning problems arising in Reinforcement Learning, Stochastic Optimization, Federated and Distributed Learning, and Active learning. My research focuses on establishing fundamental limits on feasible performance and developing machine learning algorithms that achieve or approach the performance limits under practical constraints in terms of computation complexity and communication costs. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2018.
