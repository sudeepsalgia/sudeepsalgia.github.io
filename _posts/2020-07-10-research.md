I am interested in sequential learning problems arising in reinforcement learning, stochastic optimization, distributed learning, bandits, bayesian optimization, and active online learning. My broad research goals are to:
 
- facilitate _provably efficient, interpretable, adaptive_ data-driven decision-making;
- investigate _fundamental trade-offs_ in distributed learning problems;
- design optimal solutions that comply with _practical systemic limitations such as communication, privacy, and computation_.

My research employs tools from high-dimensional statistics, probability theory, large-scale optimization, information theory and machine learning.
